An organization to provide almost reliable [Minecraft] mods and modpacks.

[Discord] | [CurseForge]

</div>

## **‚ùì Who are we?**

We are a small team of people whose goal is to develop innovative and, quite contrary to our name, reliable mods and modpacks for the game [Minecraft].

Most of us have years of experience and want this team to represent good products so that players can be confident that they will have a good gaming experience.

We strive for a team of members with different qualifications. Members such as developers, designers or content creators help us to complete our projects without outside help.

## **üëÄ Story of our name**

The team was founded by [Relentless] and [Lytho]. Both of them have the same habit of having good ideas, implementing them and not finishing the projects after 80% completion.

The original plan was to call the team '80Percent', but unfortunately the name was already taken. This led to the agreement on AlmostReliable, which describes not so much the projects, but rather the founding members themselves.

## **üîß How do we work?**

Each of our developers can always come up with their own projects and work on them. Whether these are included in the name of the team is done by vote.

We always try to keep a certain quality standard. Therefore, there are [contribution guidelines] for each project, as well as frameworks and automation.

The reward for the mod or the pack is always up to the author, who is free to decide how to distribute it. The project always belongs to the author and is not taken over by Almost Reliable. If you want to leave the team, you can do it without fearing for your releases.

There is only one special case where you are not allowed to publish your work after leaving, for example because it is built on private frameworks.

## **üíö Are you interested?**

We are always happy to welcome new members who contribute their own ideas and help us with our work. Whether you are a developer, an artist, or someone who just wants to talk to us, feel free to reach out.

If you are interested, feel free to visit us on our community [Discord]!
