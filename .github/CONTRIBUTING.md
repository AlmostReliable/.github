[GitHub] | [Discord]

</div>

## **üìë Code of Conduct**
For everything in the project, the [Code of Conduct] applies.<br>
Help us to keep our projects open and inclusive.

## **‚ùì Questions & Support**
Do not use the [issue tracker](#-issue-tracker) for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

Instead, we recommend using our [Discord] to ask questions and discuss things.

To save your time and ours, we will close contributions that belong to the general support category without further feedback.

## **üêû Issue Tracker**
The issue tracker is the preferred method to report bugs and request features. You can also do so in our [Discord] but we will quickly lose focus there.

This serves three purposes:
1. having everything centralized in one spot
2. structuring the contributions into logical aspects
3. keeping the community involved in what's going on

Please respect the following restrictions:
1. Do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests! We have a [Discord] for support.
2. Follow the respective templates and fill them out to the best of your ability.
3. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinion of others.
4. Avoid posting multiple issues about the same topic.
5. Keep yourself up to date and check if you have the newest version and if your bug report or feature request was already processed.

To save your time and ours, we will close contributions that violate our rules or the restrictions without further feedback.

## **üß† Pull Requests**
Pull requests are a good method to contribute to the project.

If you consider opening a pull request, thanks a lot. We appreciate the effort and try our best to process it.

The pull request should follow the respective pull request template. The recommended steps to contribute to a project are:
1. [Fork] the project.
2. [Create a new branch][branch] with a descriptive and short name.
3. Apply your changes.
4. Make sure you also update the documentation accordingly.
5. Push the code to your own branch.
6. [Open a pull request][pull request] with a clear title and description.

Many of our projects follow the same contribution guidelines and ship helpful resources.<br>
Please make sure to make use of the provided and existing code styles in the project.

**Important:**<br>
By creating a pull request, you agree to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.

## **üíò Thank you**
We are grateful for any contribution to our projects.

Stay awesome!
